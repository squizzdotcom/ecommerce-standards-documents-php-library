# Ecommerce Standards Documents PHP Library
The Ecommerce Standards Documents provides an open standard for storing different kinds of Ecommerce data, allowing the data be supported and transferred between business systems in a consistent, platform independent, software independent way. 
Its aims are to provide an open, easy, and efficient way of allowing different software providers to allow Ecommerce data to be exchanged, reducing the complexities of integrations, cutting down development costs, and saving time for everybody.
The Ecommerce Standards Document PHP library provides an implementation of the standards that allows the library to be embedded into PHP software, and utilised by the software to store and transfer Ecommerce Standards Documents using the classes provided.
To get a basic understanding of how to library in PHP applications it is recommended to read through the documentation available at [https://www.squizz.com/esd/index.html](https://www.squizz.com/esd/index.html)

Note that currently this PHP libary only contains a small subset of the classes available in the Ecommerce Standards Documents library. We will be looking to add more classes over time to get it up to speed with the [.NET](https://github.com/squizzdotcom/ecommerce-standards-documents-dotnet-library) and [Java](https://github.com/squizzdotcom/ecommerce-standards-documents-java-library) libraries of the standards.
